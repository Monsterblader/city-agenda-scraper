AGENDA ITEM

DATE:

January 20, 2021

TO:

Mayor and City Council  

FROM:

Sea Shelton, Human Resources Manager

SUBJECT: SALARY SCHEDULE AND BENEFIT UPDATE

Adopt  a  Resolution  approving  a  Salary  Schedule  and benefits  for  City  of  Aliso  Viejo 
employees.

Recommended Action:

Fiscal Impact:

The estimated budget impact to adjust Senior Recreation Leader and Recreation Leader 
hourly rates to meet the State’s minimum wage requirements is $4,433 for the remainder 
of FY 2020-21.  This assumes that hiring for a Spring 2020 Ranch opening proceeds and 
no further  delays  are caused  by the  COVID-19 pandemic. There  is no fiscal  impact to 
adjust  the  Director  of  Government  Services  salary  range for  FY  2020-21. The  fiscal 
impact to adjust the salary range for the Director of Recreation and Community Services
is  $3,940 for  the  remainder  of  FY  2020-21.  The  fiscal  impact  to  provide  cell  phone 
allowances  for  two  positions for  the five months  remaining  in  the  current  fiscal  year  is 
$750.

Background: 

State Minimum Wage 

California Senate Bill 3 (Leno) was signed into law on April 4, 2016, setting the stage to 
raise the  state minimum wage by set amounts each  year to reach $15.00  per hour  by 
January 1, 2022, for employers with 26 or more employees, and by January 1, 2023, for 
employers with 25 or fewer employees. After the $15.00 per hour threshold is reached, 
on  or  before  August  1  of  that  year  (and  each  year  thereafter),  increases  to  the  State 
minimum  wage will increase annually based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) up to 
3.5% per year. The range minimum of the City’s salary ranges should be at a least the 
State’s set minimum wage.

Department Director Salaries

In 2018, the City Council approved an updated Classification and Compensation plan at 
the conclusion of  a  study  conducted  by  an  independent  consultant.  Before the  plan’s
completion, Department Director salary ranges were set equally except for the Director 
of Community Services whose salary was set at a lower range. This continued to be the 
case  after  completion  of  the  classification  and  compensation  study. At  the  time of  the 
study, the City had very limited Recreation programs. Due to the lack of programming in 
the Department at the time, a lower salary range was reasonable.  Since the study was 
completed,  the  Community  Services  Department  has  expanded  significantly with  the 
addition of multiple recreation and community service programs.  To illustrate the change 
in the department’s overall contribution and depth, the department was renamed to the 
Recreation and Community Services Department in 2019. The Department’s role within 
the  City  will  continue  to  expand  with  the  opening  of  The  Ranch.  The Recreation  and 
Community Services Director will oversee several additional programs out of the City’s 
new Ranch facility including recreation classes, day camp programs, and facility rentals.  

At the May 20, 2020 meeting, the City Council approved retitling the City Clerk position 
to Director of Government Services to reflect additional  duties and responsibilities that 
have been added to the position. The current incumbent performs many tasks beyond 
the typical functions a City Clerk position. Additional duties include overseeing the PIO 
functions,  website  management,  and  various  special  projects  assigned  by  the  City 
Manager. The position also serves as Acting City Manager in the City Manager’s absence.
At the time of the retitling, a salary range adjustment had not been proposed. This created 
a second Department Director position with a salary range below that of the majority of 
Department Directors.

Cell Phone Allowances

Certain  pay  and  benefits  must  be  brought  forward  to  the  City  Council  for  approval 
including  cell  phone  allowances.    The  City recognizes that,  due  to the  nature of  some 
positions,  it  may  be  more  cost-effective  and  give  more  flexibility  to  provide  some 
employees a cellular phone allowance in lieu of providing the employee with a City-owned 
cellular phone.

Discussion: 

Minimum Wage 

Effective January 1, 2020, the State’s minimum wage increased to $14.00 per hour for 
employers with 26  or more  employees.  The  only City position that  has a starting  rate
below the State minimum wage is the Recreation Leader position. Although all incumbent 
Recreation Leaders are being paid according to the State’s minimum wage requirements, 
the salary range for the position needs to be updated so the minimum hourly rate meets 
the  minimum  wage  rate.    In  addition,  in  order  to  prevent  compaction  between  the

Recreation Leader and Senior Recreation Leader positions, an adjustment for the Senior 
Recreation Leader hourly range is also being proposed.  

The Senior Recreation Leader job classification performs all the function of a Recreation 
Leader in addition to providing on-site supervision of Recreation Leaders and volunteers.  
Also,  a  Senior  Recreation  leader  must  have  at  least  two-years  work  experience  in 
recreation, childcare, and facilities set-up and operations.  Previous experience in these
areas is not a requirement for the Recreation Leader job classification.  The proposed 
wage gap between the Recreation Leader and Senior Recreation is fifteen (15) percent.  
In addition to adjusting the salary ranges for the 2021 minimum wage increase, it is being 
proposed that the City Council approve adjustments to both positions effective January 
1, 2022, when the State’s next minimum wage will increase to $15.00 per hour.  The same 
wage gap of fifteen (15) percent will apply between the positions in 2022.

Department Director Salary Adjustments

In  order  to  provide  pay equity  among  all  the  City’s Department  Director  positions,  it  is 
being recommended that the salary ranges for the Director of Government Services and 
the Director of Recreation and Community Services be adjusted to be equal to the other 
Department  Directors.  The  level  of  responsibility and oversight among  all  the  City’s 
department directors are equal and as such pay should also be comparable. Pay equity 
is important in any organization as it can increase efficiency, creativity and productivity in 
addition to help reduce turnover and increase commitment to the organization. 

The  incumbent Director  of  Government  Services current  annual  salary  is  within  the 
proposed  salary  range and  no  pay adjustment  is needed  at  this  time.   The  incumbent 
Director of  Recreation and  Community Services current annual salary is slightly below 
the  proposed  annual  minimum  and  a  salary  adjustment  would  be  necessary.    The 
estimated  cost  to  bring  the  Director  of  Recreation  and  Community  Services to  the 
proposed annual minimum for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2020-2021 is $3,940.

The City provides a cell phone allowance in the amount of $75.00 per month for certain 
positions where  there  is  a  business  need  to  be  able  to  reach  an employee  on  their
personal cell phones outside of normal business hours.  It is being proposed that a cell 
phone allowance be provided to the Management Analyst and Executive Assistant. The 
Management  Analyst assists  the  Director  of  Government  Services with  the  City’s  PIO 
functions including website/social media updates, press releases, and special projects for 
the City Manager’s Office. These job functions may require the Management Analyst to 
be reachable after hours or on weekends. The Executive Assistant  provides executive 
and confidential support to the City Manager and City Council.  The position supports the 
City’s management who often works after hours or on the City’s dark Fridays and may be 
needed after hours or when the City is closed.
