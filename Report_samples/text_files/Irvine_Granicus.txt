RE: 

Resolution - United States Postal Service 

Please place a resolution on  the agenda for the meeting of the  Irvine City Council on 
September 8,  2020 urging the United States Postmaster General to end  all actions that 
slow down or undermine the prompt delivery mail services. 

Recently,  the United states Postmaster General has unlawfully and unilaterally 
implemented a series of revisions to  the postal service's protocols and procedures. The 
changes threaten to undermine the timely delivery of mail across the county,  including 
the City of Irvine. We have received complaints from  Irvine residents that mailboxes 
have been removed from various locations around the city - limiting access to postal 
services for our community.  Such changes to the postal service's protocol threaten our 
resident's basic right to affordable and equitable delivery of essentials through the 
United  States Postal Service. 

Especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic it is essential for all residents -
especially veterans,  seniors, and small businesses, to  recefve deliveries in  a timely 
manner.  Residents rely on the United States Postal Service to  receive medications, 
stimulus checks,  social security checks, census forms,  rent checks,  medical supplies, 
election  ballots,  and  other essential items.

affordable and equitable communication and delivery as  a basic right; and is

election ballots; 

WHEREAS, The Postal Service is  one of the most important employers in the United

WHEREAS, the United States Postmaster General has unilaterally implemented a 
series of revisions to the postal service's protocols and procedures that threaten to 
undermine the timely delivery of mail across the country, including Irvine. These 
unilateral changes have included: 

•  Removing mailbox locations around the country, including in Irvine and other 

cities in Orange County; 

•  Decommissioning mail-sorting machines, with severe reductions in sorting 

capacity and the speed of delivery; 

•  Severely limiting employees from working overtime, despite reported increases 
in demand and the need to compensate for employees who are out sick or at 
home quarantining; and 
Instructing letter carriers to leave mail behind if it delays routes, running 
counter to the training postal workers traditionally receive to ensure prompt 
delivery of the mail; 

• 

WHEREAS, the USPS has warned several states, including California, that it could no 
longer guarantee timely compliance with all state election deadlines and delivery of all 
ballots cast by mail for the presidential election.
