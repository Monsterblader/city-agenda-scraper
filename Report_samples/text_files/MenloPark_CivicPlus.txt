Identify a preferred conceptual design for the 
Sharon Road sidewalk project and adopt Resolution 
No. 6610 restricting parking hours along Sharon 
Road and establishing a 15 miles per hour zone at 
La Entrada Middle School   

Recommendation 
Staff recommends that the City Council approve the following for the Sharon Road sidewalk project: 
• An asphalt strip design, with restricted day time parking, at the north side of Sharon Road from Alameda

de las Pulgas to Altschul Avenue (Option A.)

• Adopt Resolution No. 6610 (Attachment A) to establish a “no stopping” on-street parking zone per Table
3 and a 15 miles per hour speed (mph) zone at La Entrada Middle School per California Vehicle Code
Section 23358.4.

The Complete Streets Commission’s recommendations for a concrete sidewalk (Option B) and a concrete 
sidewalk with a parking lane (Option C) are described later in this report.  

Policy Issues 
The project is consistent with the 2016 general plan circulation element and is included in the fiscal year 
2020-21 capital improvement program. Circulation element policy CIRC-1.9 supports Safe Routes to School 
programs which enhance the safety of school children who walk and bike to school. 

Background 
Existing street profile 
The project spans Sharon Road from Alameda de las Pulgas to the intersection of La Entrada Middle 
School at Altschul Avenue. Sharon Road is identified in the circulation element of the general plan as a 
bicycle boulevard, defined as a low volume residential street servicing local vehicles, bicyclists and 
pedestrians. This corridor is also used by students of La Entrada Middle School and included in its Safe 
Routes to School (Attachment B) map.  

The existing right-of-way is 60 feet wide and includes a two-way road, varying between 21 to 30 feet in 
width, with residential frontages beyond the edge of pavement. Sharon Road serves approximately 3,500 
vehicles daily and has a posted speed of 25 mph. Frontage features consist of planting, heritage trees, 
gravel, retaining walls, limited sidewalks and asphalt strips. Parallel parking is available on both sides of 
Sharon Road, however, neither side has a continuous walkway. The site is prone to ponding due to existing 
low points and inadequate gutters. As a result, pedestrians are reported to walk into the roadway to bypass 
local ponding. The current walkable area is also obstructed by unrestricted parking. Police records reveal

one collision with minor injuries in the project limit since 2008. The incident occurred at night and involved a 
driver and stationary object.  
 
In June 2018, a petition was submitted to staff with signatures of residents of the 2100 block of Sharon 
Road to gauge support for a walkway within the project limits. Signed petitions indicating support for the 
initiative were received from 75 percent of properties along the corridor.  
 
Design options and public outreach 
On January 15, 2020, staff held a meeting to solicit community input on two design options (Attachment C) 
at the multipurpose room at LaEntrada Middle School. Eighteen attendees were present at the meeting 
including residents of Sharon Road, representatives from Parents for Safe Routes, and other neighboring 
stakeholders. Both design options feature intersection improvements at Altschul Avenue and Alameda de 
las Pulgas, drainage mitigation to reduce ponding during rain events, and minimal impacts to heritage trees 
and large landscaping features, similar to the criteria used in the design of phases 1 and 2 of Santa Cruz 
Avenue sidewalks. The advantages and disadvantages of each option are assessed further in the Analysis 
section below.  
 
Option A includes an asphalt strip with a two-foot wide valley gutter that retains on-street parking outside of 
school arrival and dismissal hours. Option B includes a concrete sidewalk with a six-inch raised curb that 
eliminates parking due to space constraints. Both options meet City standards and American with Disability 
Act (ADA) design requirements and have been commonly constructed in Menlo Park neighborhoods. Staff 
received 19 online comments after the meeting of which 12 favored the asphalt path, five favored the 
concrete sidewalk, and two supported either option. Stakeholders supporting the asphalt pathway, including 
residents of Sharon Road, were attracted to its fewer frontage impacts and potential to retain parking. 
Proponents of the raised concrete sidewalk preferred the elevated curb as a physical barrier and safety 
feature. Multiple commenters encouraged lowering the site’s speed limit and requested the selected design 
account for drainage improvements. These and other design considerations are detailed in Table 1 in the 
Analysis section.  
 
Complete Streets Commission (CSC) meeting 
On September 9, 2020, staff presented to the CSC and recommended Option A with a reduced 15 mph 
zone along La Entrada Middle School. Stakeholders and residents supporting both Options A and B were 
present during the meeting and 12 public commenters spoke on the project. Staff noted that while both 
designs provide access to La Entrada Middle School, Option A retains on-street parking outside designated 
school hours, reflects the aesthetic of this block of Sharon Road, and carries fewer frontage and cost 
impacts. The CSC voted in favor of Option B (7-1-1) citing the benefit of a raised curb to separate 
pedestrians from bicycles and vehicles. The CSC also requested maintenance costs of each option for the 
City Council’s consideration. Lastly, the CSC requested evaluation of a third design option that incorporates 
a parking lane and concrete sidewalk (Option C.) Staff’s response is noted in the Analysis section.  
 

Analysis 
Table 1 details the basis of design for Options A, B and C. These criteria include site constraints,  
intersection improvements, drainage, parking, bicycle and pedestrian safety, speed reduction and cost.

Speed reduction 

Table 1: Basis of design 

The north side of Sharon Road (even house numbers) has less obstructions, and is 
wider, than the south side (odd house numbers.) Therefore, constructing the 
pedestrian facility along the north side is preferable. The south side includes steeper 
grades, more heritage trees, and utility poles along the proposed path of travel. The 
southern span of Sharon Road would also require installation of an additional 
pedestrian crossing at Sharon Court (which is narrow and heavily planted.)  

All design options propose ADA-compliant sidewalks, driveways, and curb ramps 
at the intersection of Sharon Road and Altschul Avenue. These improvements are 
critical for access to La Entrada Middle School. The project will also consider 
similar improvements at the intersection of Alameda de las Pulgas which is in San 
Mateo County’s jurisdiction. The County is currently developing a corridor plan for 
this intersection and the City will continue coordination efforts for future designs in 
this area as part of that project’s Task Force.  

All design options include a concrete valley gutter spanning the south side of 
Sharon Road to mitigate ponding issues (Attachment C.) On the north side of 
Sharon Road, the asphalt path includes a 24” concrete valley gutter which conveys 
stormwater and acts as a separator between pedestrian and roadway traffic. The 
concrete sidewalk option would include a raised curb and gutter that provides 
similar drainage benefits.  

Option A’s asphalt path would also serve as a parking strip along the north side of 
Sharon Road where right of way width allows. Parking along the strip would be 
prohibited during school drop off, pick up and recess times per Table 3. Option B 
eliminates north-side parking entirely due to lack of space while Option C retains 
parking but is not recommended based on frontage and cost impacts (see Table 
2.) 

Sharon Road is categorized as a bicycle boulevard, a low volume, residential street 
with shared bicycle and vehicle access. Therefore, a Class III bicycle route with 
shared lane markings (sharrows) is proposed with respect to this roadway 
classification. Class II bike lanes are impractical given insufficient street width. 

Option A’s asphalt path includes a 24” concrete valley gutter along the edge of 
pavement to separate pedestrian and roadway traffic. This design option would 
also feature signing and striping to further distinguish paths of travel and establish 
no stopping and 15 mph zones. Option B’s concrete sidewalk includes a 6” vertical 
curb to isolate foot traffic from bicycles and vehicles.  

The project includes the proposal to install a 15 mph zone within 500 feet from La 
Entrada Middle School per the adopted 2019 Citywide Engineering and Traffic 
Study (Study) approved by the City Council October 15, 2020. The Study 
establishes City speed limits based on the California Vehicle Code (CVC) which 
allows local jurisdictions, by resolution, to reduce speed limits to 15 mph at 500 
feet from school grounds when children are present. Signage for the speed 
reduction will be installed at all intersections and ingress egress points overlapping 
the 15 mph zone. Refer to Attachment D for a site plan.  

Project cost  

Preliminary estimates are included in Table 2 and assume design, construction and 
administrative fees. 

 
CSC feedback and recommendations 
The CSC requested a third design option that includes a concrete sidewalk with on-street parking (Option 
C.) This design would require widening the north side of Sharon Road by an additional 8-feet. 
Consequently, Option C results in higher frontage and cost impacts compared to Options A and B and

3. Preliminary estimates include design, construction contingencies and construction administration 

 
Staff also prepared an estimate of maintenance costs of asphalt and concrete with input from paving 
specialists. In summary, asphalt strips are designed for a 15-year life span but are cheaper to construct. By 
contrast, concrete sidewalks are typically designed for a 40-year life span but have higher installation costs. 
While the City will fund construction costs for the project, subsequent maintenance of the either the asphalt 
strip or concrete sidewalk is the responsibility of the adjacent property owner per municipal code section 
13.08 unless damage is caused by a City street tree. The average annual maintenance cost of asphalt and 
concrete, are approximately $0.40 and $0.30, per square foot, respectively. This estimate is based on the 
cost of installing each material divided by its expected life span.  
   
Recommendations 
Staff recommends Option A for the project. The asphalt strip follows City standards for low-volume 
residential streets such as Sharon Road and provides access to La Entrada Middle School. The walking 
path includes striping and a 24-inch valley gutter that drains the site and separates the path from the street. 
Option A is also widest option which allows maneuverability for students traveling in groups. These safety 
elements are enhanced with signage designating the 15 mph school zone speed limit and restricted parking 
times (Table 3.) Furthermore, Option A carries the lowest construction cost, impact to frontages, and 
reflects the aesthetic of 2100 block Sharon Road. 
 
Staff also recommends adopting Resolution No. 6610 (Attachment A) to establish a no stopping zone along

the north side of Sharon Road during select school hours (Table 3.) Table 3 reflects the 2019 to 2020 bell 
times for La Entrada Middle School, however, staff may adjust this as required to reflect bell schedule 
changes in future school years. The morning parking restrictions would be between 8:05 a.m. to 8:35 a.m. 
to accommodate the 8:30 a.m. start time for all students. The afternoon parking restrictions would be 
between 2:40 p.m. to 3:40 p.m. to accommodate the 3 p.m. end time for fourth and fifth graders, and the 
3:15 p.m. end time for sixth to eighth graders.

Resolution No. 6610 also establishes a 15 mph school zone within 500 feet from La Entrada Middle School 
pursuant to CVC 22358.4. These zones are proposed at street segments along Altschul Avenue, Avy 
Avenue, Deanna Drive, Eastridge Avenue, Monte Rosa Drive, Sharon Road, Warner Range Avenue, and 
Zachary Court and shown schematically per Attachment D. Speed reduction zones would also be 
accompanied by signs installed at every intersection and ingress, egress points.  
 
Next steps 
Staff will proceed with the design of Option A subject to the City Council’s approval. The project is 
tentatively scheduled for construction bidding in the spring 2021 with the aim to finish construction before 
the 2021-22 school year. Option B would carry a similar bidding and construction schedule should the City 
Council select it as the design alternative, however, this schedule may shift if additional outreach efforts with 
residents of Sharon Road during design and construction are deemed necessary. Staff does not 
recommend Option C as it would require extensive coordination and permitting based on impact to heritage 
trees, utility poles and existing frontage features. Consequently, the earliest bidding and construction 
schedule for Option C is estimated for autumn or winter 2021 respectively. Note that this schedule may be 
further delayed to spring and summer of 2022 based on inclement weather and impact to school schedules.  

Impact on City Resources 
This project is included in the capital improvement program with a total budget of $935,000. To date, there 
is approximately $850,000 in available funds when factoring completed tasks for conceptual design, public 
outreach, land surveying and renderings. Preliminary estimates for the asphalt strip, including design, 
construction contingencies and construction administration, total $610,000. Consequently, the project is 
expected to fall within its available budget. No additional funds or staff resources are requested at this time 
for either Option A or B.  
 

Environmental Review 
The project is categorically exempt under Section 15301 – Class 1 and Section 15304 – Class 4 of the 
current California Environmental Quality Act Guidelines. Both sections allow for minor alterations of existing 
facilities, including existing highways and streets, sidewalks, gutters, bicycle and pedestrian access, and 
similar facilities, as long as there is negligible or no expansion of use.
