REPORT NARRATIVE: 
Best  practices  in  municipal  finance  recommend  investment  policies  be  reviewed 
annually or at a minimum, the internal treasury  staff should conduct a review annually.  
An  update  in  the  investment  policy  is  warranted  if  staff’s  review  results  in  a  material 
change in policy due to either a change in statute or a change in the City’s investment 
objectives.  Finance  continues  to  monitor  changes  to  the  California  Government  Code 
regarding investment parameters and allowable investments that may impact the City’s 
investment  policy.  The  redlined  version  of  the  City’s  investment  policy  is  attached  for 
review  and  approval  (Attachment  2).  The  proposed  changes  to  the  investment  policy 
would expand the allowable investment to include certificate of deposits, capping at the 
maximum  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  (FDIC)  legal  limit  amount  per  FDIC-
insured  institution,  currently  at  $250,000.  Expanding  the  list  of  allowable  investments 
would allow the City more options as we look to increase the City portfolio’s short-term 
returns while maintaining the City’s investment objectives of safety, liquidity, and yield. 
 
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT: Inform 
Finance periodically renders to City Council for review and approval any changes to the 
investment  policy  at  a  public  meeting.    In  addition,  the  City’s  investment  policy  is 
available on the City’s website. 
 
ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS: 
Not Applicable. 
 
PRIOR CITY COUNCIL AND COMMISSION ACTIONS: 
The City Council approved the last revision to its investment policy in July 2016.
