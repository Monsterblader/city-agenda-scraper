Fiscal Impact:

None

Background: 

At their regularly scheduled meeting on June 17, 2020, the City Council directed Staff to 
prepare an ordinance which would limit the amount of medical uses permitted in the Town 
Center Commercial (CT) zone.  

The  public  hearing  for  the  item  was  opened  at  the  City  Council’s  regularly  scheduled 
meeting on September 16, 2020.  At that meeting, the City Council directed Staff to make 
certain modifications to the Ordinance and continued the public hearing to October 21, 

2020  to  allow  Staff  time  to  complete  their  research  and  make  recommendations  as 
appropriate. 

Discussion: 

Due to a concern over the City’s limited amount of retail space converting into medical 
uses,  the  City  Council  directed  Staff  to  prepare  an  ordinance  limiting  the  amount  of 
medical uses that can be permitted in the Town Center.  

According to research conducted by Planning Division Staff, there is a total of 506,674 
square feet of building space in the Town Center Commercial (CT) Zone.  Of the total 
square footage, approximately 10.9% or 55,073 square feet of medical uses have been 
approved.  Of the existing medical uses, 17,171 square feet are located on the first floor 
and 37,902 square feet are on second and third floors. 

The original draft ordinance presented to the City Council on September 16, 2020, set a 
maximum of 60,000 square feet of total medical use space in the CT Zone.  During the 
course of that meeting, the City Council directed staff to revise the ordinance to limit the 
square footage of medical uses only on the first floor. This would preserve the first floor 
for commercial and retail uses, which is their optimal location.  

The  revised  ordinance  would  set  a  cap  on  the  total  square  footage  of  medical  uses 
permitted on the first floor of buildings within the CT Zone to 20,000.  This would allow for 
some additional square footage on the first floor either through an expansion of an existing 
use or a new user. The cap would be established in Table 15.18.020 Permitted uses in 
the nonresidential districts of the Aliso Viejo Municipal Code. An amendment is proposed 
to  Footnote  5,  which  would  limit  outpatient  medical  uses  in  the  CT  Zone  to  a  total  of 
20,000  square  feet  on  the  first  floor.  No  limitation  would  be  placed  on  building  space 
above the first floor.

Public Notice:

Section 15061(b)(3) of the  CEQA Guidelines establishes a statutory exemption for the 
adoption of an ordinance because it will not result in a direct or reasonably foreseeable 
indirection physical change in the environment because there is no possibility that it may 
have a significant effect on the environment and because it is not a “project” as the term 
in  defined  in  Section  15378  of  the  State  CEQA  Guidelines.    The  proposed  Code 
amendment qualifies for this exemption.  

In accordance with the requirements of Government Code section 65090, the ordinance 
was noticed in a newspaper of general circulation.  The original public hearing date was 
set for September 16, 2020. At that meeting, the City Council opened the public hearing 
and continued the item to a date certain: October 21, 2020. Notice of the continued public 
hearing was posted in accordance with Government Code Section 54955.1.
