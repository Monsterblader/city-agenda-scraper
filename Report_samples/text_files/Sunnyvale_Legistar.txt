BACKGROUND 
 
The proposed 0.45-acre park site at Mora Place and Ortega Avenue was dedicated by the 
developers  of  the  2296  Mora  Drive  rowhouse  project.    On  January  23,  2018,  the  City 
Council  approved  a  contract  with  S.S.A.  Landscape  Architects,  Inc.,  for  design  of  the 
park.  During the design process, staff held two community meetings and brought the 
preferred  concept  supported  by  community  meeting  attendees  to  the  Parks  and 
Recreation Commission (PRC) on May 8, 2019.  
 
On October 1, 2019, Council approved the concept recommended by the PRC and “Mora 
Park” as the name.  On April 14, 2020, Council approved the public art proposal for a 
mosaic bench by Angelina Duckett.  See Figure 1 for the approved conceptual plan.

Amend Professional Services Contract 
 
During the final design work, there was a change to the initial surface conditions that had 
been surveyed by the consultant at project inception.  The makeup of the existing surface 
soil was found to be unsuitable for the landscape planting that was anticipated.  Due to 
this, the City requested the developer to remove the surface soil, at their cost, after the 
developer’s staging activities were completed.  This changed the surface conditions, and 
additional surveying work was needed. 
 
The  contingency  in  the  professional  services  contract  was  expended  due  to  these 
unforeseen  conditions  to  revise  and  complete  the  design  plans.    Staff  recommends 
amending  the  contract  with  S.S.A.  Landscape  Architects,  Inc.,  to  provide  additional 
contingency for use during the construction phase.  The recommended amendment will 
increase the existing $190,000 design services contract by $20,000 for a total compensation 
of $210,000.  There is adequate funding in the project for this amendment. 
 
Environmental Clearance 
 
Following  Council’s  approval  of  a  conceptual  plan  on  October  1,  2019,  a  categorical 
exemption was filed for this project as a Class 4, Minor Alterations to Land, for the new 
park in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). 
 
Project Schedule 
 
If Council approves the recommended actions, construction is expected to begin in early 
2021 and be completed by fall 2021.  
 
FISCAL IMPACT 
 
Mora Park, Project 17-46, is funded with $1,628,000 from the Park Land Dedication Fund 
and $36,168 from the 2296 Mora Drive development for the site’s soil management and 
air  monitoring  plan  (site  management  plan).    The  developer  funds  will  be  used  for 
implementing measures identified in the site management plan, as needed, during and 
after construction of the park.  On June 30, 2020, the City Council approved $350,000 of 
Fiscal  Years  2015-18  Community  Development  Block  Grant  (CDBG)  funds  for  the 
construction of Mora Park.  Upon Council’s approval, $350,000 of the CDBG funds will
