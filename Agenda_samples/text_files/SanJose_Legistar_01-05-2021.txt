The City of San José is committed to open and honest government and strives to consistently meet the 
community’s expectations by providing excellent service, in a positive and timely manner, and in the 
full view of the public. 

Welcome to the San José City Council meeting! 

This Agenda contains both a Consent Calendar section for routine business items that require Council 
approval, and general business items arranged to correspond with San José’s City Service Areas (CSAs). 
City Service Areas represent the policy-making level for strategic planning, policy setting, and investment 
decisions in the critical functions the City provides to the community. They are: 

• Strategic Support - The internal functions that enable the CSAs to provide direct 
   services to the community in an effective and efficient manner.

• Public Safety - Commitment to excellence in public safety by investing in neighborhood 
  partnerships as well as prevention, enforcement, and emergency preparedness services.

• Transportation & Aviation Services - A safe and efficient transportation system that contributes to 
  the livability and economic health of the City; and provide for the air transportation needs of the 
  community and the region at levels that is acceptable to the community.

• Environmental and Utility Services - Manage environmental services and utility systems to ensure 
  a sustainable environment for the community.   

• Neighborhood Services - Serve, foster, and strengthen community by providing access to lifelong 
   learning and opportunities to enjoy life.  

• Community & Economic Development - Manage the growth and change of the community in 
   order to create and preserve healthy neighborhoods and ensure a diverse range of employment and 
   housing opportunities.

You may speak to the City Council about any discussion item that is on the agenda, and you may also speak 
during Open Forum on items that are not on the agenda and are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the 
City Council or Successor Agency to the Redevelopment Agency Board. If you wish to speak to the City 
Council, please refer to the following guidelines:

o Fill out a Yellow Speaker’s Card and submit it to the City Clerk seated at the front table. Do 
   this before the meeting or before the item is heard. This will ensure that your name is called for 
   the item(s) that you wish to address, and it will help ensure the meeting runs smoothly for all 
   participants. 
o When the Council reaches your item on the agenda, the Mayor will open the public hearing and call 
   your name. Please address the Council from the podium, which is located to the left of the City 
   Clerk’s table. 

o Each speaker generally has two minutes to speak per item. The amount of time allotted to 
     speakers may vary at the Mayor’s discretion, depending on the number of speakers or the length 
     of the agenda. 
o To assist you in tracking your speaking time, there is a display on the podium. The green light 
     turns on when you begin speaking; the yellow light turns on when you have 30 seconds left; and 
     the red light turns on when your speaking time is up. 

Please be advised that, by law, the City Council is unable to discuss or take action on issues presented during 
Open Forum. According to State Law (the Brown Act) items must first be noticed on the agenda before any 
discussion or action.

The San José City Council meets every Tuesday at 1:30 p.m. and Tuesday at 6 p.m. as needed, 
unless otherwise noted.  The City Council, or less than a quorum, may adjourn any regular, special 
or adjourned meeting to a later date, time and place specified in the order of adjournment.  If all 
members are absent, the City Clerk may declare the meeting adjourned to a stated date, time and 
place. If you have any questions, please direct them to the City Clerk’s staff seated at the tables 
just below the dais.  Thank you for taking the time to attend today’s meeting.  We look forward to

fairness, courtesy, and respect for differing points of view. 

1. Public Meeting Decorum: 

a) Persons in the audience will refrain from behavior which will disrupt the public meeting.  
    This will include making loud noises, clapping, shouting, booing, hissing or engaging in 
    any other activity in a manner that disturbs, disrupts or impedes the orderly conduct of the   
    meeting. 
b) Persons in the audience will refrain from creating, provoking or participating in any type   
    of disturbance involving unwelcome physical contact. 
c) Persons in the audience will refrain from using cellular phones and/or pagers while the 
    meeting is in session. 
d) Appropriate attire, including shoes and shirts are required in the Council Chambers and 
    Committee Rooms at all times. 
e) Persons in the audience will not place their feet on the seats in front of them. 
f) No food, drink (other than bottled water with a cap), or chewing gum will be allowed in the 
   Council Chambers and Committee Rooms, except as otherwise pre-approved by City staff. 
g) All persons entering the Council Chambers and Committee Rooms, including their bags,   
    purses, briefcases and similar belongings, may be subject to search for weapons and other 
   dangerous materials. 

2. Signs, Objects or Symbolic Material: 

a) Objects and symbolic materials, such as signs or banners, will be allowed in the Council   
    Chambers and Committee Rooms, with the following restrictions: § No objects will be

    passage of other attendees, or otherwise disturb the business of the meeting. 
c) Objects that are deemed a threat to persons at the meeting or the facility infrastructure are

3. Addressing the Council, Committee, Board or Commission:

    and/or during open forum; the time limit is in the discretion of the Chair of the meeting 
    and may be limited when appropriate. Applicants and appellants in land use matters are
